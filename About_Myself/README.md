About myself

My name is Ruslan Koshcheev.
For nine years I served in command engineer position of the signal troops of the Armed Forces in Belarus.
I decided to grow in technical direction. I have experience with telecommunications and networking equipment, virtualization.
Familiar with Powershell, Windows Server AD DS, Linux, Bash, Azure. I am constantly educating in the systems engineering direction.
Since September 2020 till March 2021 I have been taking EPAM LAB training in the area of Cloud and DevOps.

This course is interesting for me because:
- Andersen is a famous company with huge experience. So our mentors could share it with us.
- I like DevOps and I want to improve my skills in tis direction.
- There is comfortable form of study for me.

My expectations about this course:
- My tech and soft skills will be strongly improved
- I will find new friends
- I will get pretty good offer for me for DevOps engineer position
